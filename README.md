# 3D-Sound-Oscilloscope

## Description
Virtual Oscilloscope that visualize various signals generated real-time.

It can generate most common Fourier Series:
* Square Wave
* Triangular Wave
* Saw Tooth Wave

Graphics achieved with [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) and [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with [SFML Binding](https://github.com/SFML/imgui-sfml).

## Todo list
* 3D sound implementation
* Better graphics
* Visualize Fourier Transform
